tips.js
=========

tips.js is a simple jQuery tooltip plugin.

Demo
----

A demo of the plugin in action can be found <a href="http://scott-lanning.com/tips">here</a>.


Installation
------------

Include <a href="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.min.js">jQuery</a> and the `tips.js` scripts:

```
<script src="js/libs/jquery.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script src="js/tips.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

Include the `tips.css` stylesheet:

```
<link href="css/tips.css" media="screen" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
```

**Note:** This plugin utilizes the new jQuery "on" method, and therefore requires jQuery 1.7 or newer.

Using tips.js
-------------

All of the files for the plugin can be found in the `build` directory. Add a `data-tooltip` attribute with the content of the tooltip.

```
<input type="email" id="email" data-tooltip="Please enter an email address" />
```

Text can be formatted within the data-tooltip attribute via special characters.

```
^heading^       :   <h1>Heading</h1>
*bold*          :   <strong>bold</strong>
~italic~        :   <em>italic</em>
Line | Break    :   Line <br /> Break

{`item one `item two `item three} :
<ul>
    <li>item one</li>
    <li>item two</li>
    <li>item three</li>
</ul>
```



Specify the optional direction of the tooltip by adding the `data-tooltip-direction` attribute with the direction you'd like. The default is right, however acceptable values are top, bottom, left, and right.

```
<input type="email" id="email" data-tooltip="Please enter an email address" data-tooltip-direction="top" />
```

Then invoke `$.tips` passing the selectors(s) you'd like to show tooltips.

```
$.tips({
    element: '.error'
});
```


Options
-------

Below are the supported options and their default values:

```
settings = {
    action: 'focus',        // tooltip display event (click, focus, hover)
    debug: false,           // debug console
    element: '.error'       // selector to run the tooltip on
    fadeSpeed: 200,         // fade speed
    html5: true,             // uses aside for tooltip instead of div for html5 supported browsers
    preventDefault: false,  // prevent default event when element is clicked on
    tailLength: 14,         // width/length of the tooltip tail for positioning
    tooltipClass: ''       // class to add to tooltip
}
```

There are several built in CSS styles for the tooltips. Currently there are styles for error, warning, and informational tooltips. Utilize the `tooltipClass` option to set one of the aforementioned classes. You can also add or modify styles in the CSS to file to tailor the tooltips to your site.

Contributing and Updates
------------------------

I would definitely appreciate any feedback. I'm working on some ideas for the next version:

1. Adding formatting for links in tooltips
2. Detecting edge of screen and repositioning tooltips
3. Adding more pre-defined CSS tooltip colors and classes
